# Book a table (with java persistence)

Book a table is a simple project to explain how to persist data with java in a database.

The application allows users to:

1. List available tables in a restaurant
1. Reserve a table for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

This project is not ready for production. Its intent is to show different methods for storing data in relational databases in action.
